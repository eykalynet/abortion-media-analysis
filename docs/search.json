All the Quarto markdown features we learned for formatting text, adding headings and subheadings, adding code and output, adding labels and captions and whatnot work as usual.\n\n\nThe website project folder/repo will contain the following files, at a minimum:\n\n_quarto.yml: A configuration file that controls the YAML content, similar to what we typically see at the top of our qmd files.\nUse this file to add or remove additional subpages, change the overall website title, customize the navigation bar contents and layout, change the website theme, and set any other default formatting options such as code chunk options.\nindex.qmd: This is the landing page of your website. This file must be called index.qmd and must be located in the root directory of the project.\nUse this page, at a minimum, to introduce your project. From there you can either fully include the contents of the project or use additional qmd files to create subpages of your website (perhaps explaining the structure of the website to the user on this landing page).\nbib folder: Contains the bibliography file, which you should edit to include your resources, and a .csl file that tells Quarto how to format in-text citations and the bibliography list according to the American Statistical Association citation style.\ndocs folder: The rendered content of the website will be located here.\nstyles.css: This file is currently empty, but if you want to modify or replace the default theme, do so here using CSS. Students in the past have used custom color palettes or custom fonts, for example.\nAdditional qmd files: If you want to add subpages with their own content, create new qmd files in your root directory to do so, being sure to include them in the list of contents in your _quarto.yml file.\n\n\n\nSimilar to the Shiny project, you will need to organize your wrangling scripts and data. You may also have other images or figures saved for displaying in your blog that will also need to be organized. Here are recommendations for organization.\n\nscripts: Store wrangling scripts in their own folder\ndata: Store datasets in their own folder, being sure to separate raw data from clean/processed data. You can do this in one of two ways: two separate data folders in the root directory (e.g., raw-data and data) or two subfolders of a single data folder (subfolders called, for example, raw, processed).\nimages: Organize saved images or figures together in their own folder. Make sure you keep track of the source of the images or figures and credit the sources in some way in your page (include source in caption and/or link image to source)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit contents of any files. Each new qmd file is a self-contained environment, so you will need to load any necessary packages and datasets for rendering that particular file at the top of that file.\nAfter updating a qmd file, Render the qmd file.

You should use standard bibtex syntax for each entry, following the examples provided. If the resource you are using doesn’t already provide a way to generate a bibtex entry, I recommend using zoterobib to generate the appropriate syntax (must change the Bibliography style to “BibTeX generic citation style”). The entries currently in library.bib are intended to provide syntax examples that capture the range of entries you are most likely to use. You will need to delete and replace the contents of library.bib with your own citation entries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe examples in library.bib are nicely formatted so you can read and follow the patterns, but formatting and order of the library.bib file doesn’t actually matter and will not be assessed. Just be sure the citations are as complete as possible (authors, titles, dates, urls, dois, etc.).\n\n\n@book{hadley2016,\n  author = {Hadley, Wickham}, \n  title = {ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis}, \n  url  = {https://ggplot2-book.org},\n  publisher = {Springer},\n  address = {New York, NY},\n  type = {Online book},\n  year = {2016},\n  edition = {3}\n}"

To cite a reference in the text, use the corresponding citation key (the first item in each bibtex entry—it shouldn’t have any spaces or special characters) and format the citation using the appropriate quarto format for in-text citations. This is similar to how we cross-reference tables and figures from code chunk labels. For example, the syntax\n@hadley2016 provides excellent examples of customizing our visualizations using **ggplot2**.\nproduces the following text:\n\nHadley (2016) provides excellent examples of customizing our visualizations using ggplot2.\n\nAnd the corresponding reference is listed in full at the bottom of this page."

There is also markdown syntax to display or embed images, but I would typically not recommend it.\n\n\n\n\n\nImage courtesy of giphy.com\n\n\n\n\nEither approach will take either a filepath to a stored file or a URL to an image or gif. Width can be specified as a percentage of the width of the page (0% to 100%; my preferred approach) or as a fixed number of units (e.g. 400px, 3in, 10cm).\nI can’t imagine a scenario where students should or would include videos within their blog, but Quarto provides guidance on embedding videos, as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe first figure of your blog will be used as the display image on our course’s landing page!"
